The first time we tried to render and upload our video, the video ended up on youtube corrupted. Though we started uploading at about 11:25, which leaves an ample 40 minutes for the upload on youtube, since we had to do it twice as it was corrupted the first time, it took as an extra 30-40 minutes to render and upload the video so that it is not corrupted, and therefore we had to submit at about 12:30. 

# ReCon üçÉüçÉ  
 Climate change is one of the biggest problems in recent history. With our software Renewable Energy Consultant (ReCon), corporations and individuals can input simple data and can find what energy source and provider is best for their location, budget, and other needs. ReCon can also display tax rebates and other data to benefit the client. ReCon will have a profound impact in the future of the fight against climate change. Our solution uses software to bypass the traditionally costly consultancy which is one of the many factors why renewable resources are so inaccessible to the economically disadvantaged. ReCon will affect the lives of people from all walks of life and shift the tides against climate change.

# How Recon Works ?

We chose to make ReCon in the form of a website, as that way it is accesible to anyone with a device and an internet connection. The website will be made with Next.Js, so we can have an elegant UI which would maximize user friendliness. Meanwhile, the backend will be hosted on Flask, and all the processing will be done in Python. Furthermore, ReCon runs using a SQLite Database, which would store all the data the app needs to produce it's analysis, such as, data about solar panel suppliers.

# Current Status
Currently, ReCon's basic UI and backend is fully complete. The app is able to take the location, budget and other requirements as inputs and calculate a general analysis for each type of renewable energy source based on location and weather. Furthermore, it has the capability to find best suppliers according to the user's needs in the their area.

# End Goal ü•Öü•Ö

Though yes, one can argue that ReCon is technically a usable app at this point, this project has a long way to go. To truly make this app helpful to a large amount of people, it would need to be able to calcualte for more complex variables, such as the electrical specifications that any system must have to operate in the user's given area and merge into that electrical grid, and many others. Furthermore, other renewable energy infrastructure, such as Geothermal heating/cooling, would need to be included in this app. Lastly, the most complex piece of the puzzle would be to generate a true database of renewable energy system suppliers. If all of this were to be done and refined to a professional level, this app would immensely make the process of shifting to renewable energy much easier for the average citizen.
